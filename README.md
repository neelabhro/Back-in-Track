# Back-in-Track
## PHASE VOCODER

## INTRODUCTION
This project proposes the tracking of rhythm of an input audio signal through a microphone. Using the tracked rhythm from the input, we change the speed of an existing sound file that is played. Hence, the existing sound file is played in sync with the real-time input from a microphone in terms of a beat.
We plan on applying Digital Signal Processing for processing the signal from the microphone. We would also use Digital Signal Processing to identify the offsets on the existing backing track and use these two parameters to achieve our target.

## OBJECTIVES
Onset Detection on the Backing Track
Onset Detection on the real-time input
Manipulation of the backing track based on the processed input
